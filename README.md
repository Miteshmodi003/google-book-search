# Google Books Search

Heroku URL: https://thawing-mountain-97618.herokuapp.com

### Overview

In this activity, I have created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I have also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
